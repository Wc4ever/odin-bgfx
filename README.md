# odin-bgfx

[Odin](https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin) bindings for [bgfx](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx).

Example with SDL2 window.

### Extra Contents

You can run the example program with `odin run example` from the root of this repository.

Static libs for the `windows_amd64` and `linux_amd64` targets are included, but you should not trust libraries downloaded this way, and [compile them yourself](https://bkaradzic.github.io/bgfx/build.html).

The example program contains compiled shaders. You will need to compile bgfx's [shaderc](https://bkaradzic.github.io/bgfx/tools.html#shader-compiler-shaderc) tool to build your own shaders.
